                As we rapidly approach the end of a hectic year of insane tech evaluations leading to a large amount of
                money
                being put into tech and the many claims of AI dominance in all markets, I thought it would be a good
                idea to go
                back and think about previous technological developments that completely changed the landscape of how we
                perceived technology. Then, after reminiscing about the past, we look towards the future to take a stab
                at
                predicting what the next 50 years of technology would look like. As is the case with predictions such as
                these,
                no matter how wide of a net we cast, we might as well be in the wrong body of water for the fish!
                Basically,
                there’s no way of knowing how right we are, even if we reference past evidence. Additionally, this is
                purely
                based on my understanding of these topics, as if I’m taking an in person essay writing test - no time
                for
                research!

            <p class="essay">
                I believe that technology as a whole aims to better the lives of people who face various issues. The
                people that
                face these issues may be singular, and the technology could end up cascading into something else
                entirely, but
                its conception is birthed from one person trying to come up with some sort of solution. We saw the
                invention of
                vehicles to solve the issue of transportation or thermal regulation for warmth during the winter and
                even
                toilets and the sewage system being designed to take waste and move it elsewhere! However, I believe the
                most
                consequential issue that cascaded into something even greater was handling data. Researchers with
                mountains of
                information who needed to access it throughout various parts of the world faced this issue of getting
                this
                information handled in a timely manner. Sure, there were phonelines in place, but this process was slow
                and
                inefficient. The solution? Invent the internet.

                The internet was incredibly consequential! Its initial creation as a way to transport data for others to
                access
                was soon available to the public, and almost instantly, gears started to shift and change was explosive.
                We had
                people from all over the world getting access to information that was normally only available in books
                or by
                knowing some guy who knows some other guy! It was incredible! So incredible, that people started to
                really
                invest a lot of time and money into every aspect of the internet. From domain names to conceptual
                purposes of
                sites, everyone and their mothers were trying to buy a piece of this new internet in order to flip it
                and make
                more money by the end of it. Unfortunately, this led to the infamous “Dotcom bubble”, which led to a
                large loss
                of revenue, but it did cause the market to refocus and start investing into essential tech businesses.

                Shortly after the development of the internet, we see major advancements in how we’re able to access the
                internet and what the internet could be used for. Many of the developments at this time were centered
                around the
                internet - smartphones, web browsers, multiplayer gaming - but even still, issues persisted. The issue
                at this
                time was how slowly things moved, and since time equals money, this meant that the slower things were,
                the more
                money was being lost. To fix this problem, we entered an era of optimization, where we try to make tech
                that’s
                much faster, more efficient, and much more affordable to manufacture. While not a singular innovation
                was made
                that really sparked a revolution, many miniature optimizations have led to the tech today to be
                incredibly
                quick, to the point where quantum computers are being talked about as if they’re sure to happen. These
                speeds
                for computation were so impressive that people were able to create algorithms that compute so quickly in
                order
                to give nearly human-like responses, and thus artificial intelligence enters the space.

                AI is not technically a new invention, but it’s a far cry from what it once was. What was once a
                technology
                invented to solve the issue of data handling, is now a system that’s incredibly advanced. We’re seeing
                algorithms mimic human-like texting, human speech patterns, human image creation, human video creation…
                Essentially, we’re seeing AI mimic being human. Their likeness to humanity is so astonishing, so
                convincing,
                that many people and their mothers have found it worthwhile to invest in. Money in the big B Billions is
                being
                thrown around by people within the tech industry that it feels like an incredible, no-brainer investment
                to
                make. Surely, with a growth this strong, this bubble doesn’t pop, right?

                And with that, we’re looking ahead into the future. Not just a year ahead, or two, or ten, and not even
                twenty years
                from now. No, we’re looking well beyond all of these milestones, towards the fifty year mark. What could
                be in
                store for us then? Well, despite my feigned cluelessness earlier, there most definitely is a high
                likelihood that the
                AI bubble dissipates in some way, where a lot of the fat and excess gets sloughed off, leaving behind a
                framework that is bound to be incredibly essential to the next ground breaking technology. This system
                of
                algorithmic machine learning is already providing incredible advancements to medical fields, so it’s
                likely that
                it’ll continue to proceed in this way. We may see a quicker consolidation of information, and rapid
                access to things we continue to search for. After all, time is limited and we need to make the most of
                it. We can’t let even one second of our lives be taken over by the process of searching through
                mountains of information.

                Not only is there going to be essentially a pinpoint access hub for all information for people to easily
                access a la Wikipedia, there’s also going to be a democratization of the current internet to where
                anyone and everyone can easily access the internet on any device with incredible speeds. I think there’s
                also a likelihood that the current internet will also see an evaporation of its current framework, where
                bigger interests and corporations currently fuel sites with advertisements. Instead, the internet will
                see new formations of laws that aim to regulate its various aspects from different groups of people.
                We’re hurdling into a situation where many new issues are sprouting because of the internet, and so
                inventions related to the internet are bound to pop up in the coming years. However, only time will tell
                when we see these changes occurring.
